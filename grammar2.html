    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>-Conditional sentences have two parts or clauses that give a condition in the dependent clause and a result in the independent clause. The condition clause usually contains an if statement. There are several different forms of conditional sentences that allow the writer to express various meanings using different tenses.</p><//b>
    <p>• Condition (if) clause + result clause</p></br>
    <p>  Conditionals are also known as if clauses, we use them to say that one thing depends on something else. They can be used to talk about something that always happens, might happen or might have happened as a result of another state, action or event.</p></b>
    <h4>Conditional sentences</h4></b>
    <p>    A conditional sentence is a type of sentence that states a condition and the outcome of that condition occurring. Conditional sentences are made up of a dependent clause and an independent clause joined to express said condition. Complete conditional sentences contain a conditional clause (often referred to as the if-clause) and the consequence. Also conditional sentences are statements discussing known factors or hypothetical situations and their consequences. The order of the clauses can usually be reversed. Conditional sentences describe a conditional situation, or a result that depends on an event occurring first. "If" one thing happens, "then" another thing will happen.</p></b>
    <p>When a dependent or subordinate clause is introduced by words such as “if,” “when,” or “unless,” the complete sentence expresses a condition. The dependent or subordinate clause states a condition or cause and is joined with an independent clause, which states the result or effect. Conditional sentences can be factual, predictive, or speculative, which determines the form of the condition and the choice of verb tenses.</p></b>
    <h4>Example</h4></b>
    <p>•	If you find a blue and white sweater, it belongs to me.</p></b>
    <p>•	When he plays his music too loud, the neighbors complain</p></b>
    <p>•	Unless there is a question, the class is dismissed</p></b>
    <p>•	If the weather is good tomorrow, we will go to the park.</p></b>
    <p>•	If your roommate decides not to come with us, we can go by ourselves.</p></b>
    <p>•	When the lease on the apartment ends, we may want to move to another building.</p></b>
    <p>•	When she misses one of the meetings, she should notify her supervisor.</p></b>
    <p>•	Unless he remains part of the study group, he might fail the exam.</p></b>
    <p>•	If she listened to her parents, she would be a wealthy woman.</p></b>
    <p>•	If we continued to practice, we could win the competition.</p></b>
    <p>•	If she invested wisely, she might regain her earlier losses.</p></b>
    <p>•	If you had asked me, I would have rejected the idea.</p></b>
    <p>•	If I had started my own business, I could have worked from home.</p></b>
    <p>•	If he had been more talented, he might have established a successful career.</p></b>
    <p>We don't always use 'IF' to introduce a condition we can also use words like: Provided that, In case, so/as long as, when, unless, as soon as.</p></b>
    <h2>The zero type conditionals</h2><br>
    <p>•	Zero conditional expresses something that is considered to be a universal truth or when one action always follows another.</p></b>
    <p>•	The zero conditional is used for when the time being referred to is now or always and the situation is real and possible. The zero conditional is often used to refer to general truths. The tense in both parts of the sentence is the simple present. In zero conditional sentences, the word "if" can usually be replaced by the word "when" without changing the meaning.</p><br>
    <p>-Zero conditionals are often known as factual conditionals, but they are not factual statements.</p>
    <p>The first part of zero conditionals includes an “if” or “when” clause in the simple present tense. The next part describes what happens as a natural result, also in simple present .This is important because the simple present is used when an action is habitual or constant.</p>
    <p>Some of the best examples which show zero conditional states are given below.</p>
    <p>-When it rains, the grass gets wet.</p></b>
    <p>-Ice melts when you heat it.</p></b>
    <p>-If people eat too much, they get fat.</p></b>
    <p>-If you touch a fire, you get burned.</p></b>
    <p>-Ice melts if you heat it</p></b>
    <p>-You get water if you mix hydrogen and oxygen.</p></b>
    <p>-Snakes bite if they are scared.</p></b>
    <p>-If babies are hungry, they cry.</p></b>
    <p>-If you heat ice, it melts.</p></b
    <p>-The trees get wet when it rains.</p></b>
    <p>-If it rains, the grass gets wet.</p></b>
    <h2>The type 1 conditionals</h2><br>
    <p>When a situation is not completely certain, it’s time for type 1 conditionals. Type 1 conditionals (or first conditionals) dictate that a result is not certain, but very that one condition will lead to another. Unlike zero conditionals, type 1 conditionals only use “if” clauses, not “when” clauses.</p><br>
    <p>Each clause in a first conditional has a different tense. The “if” clause is still in the simple present tense, but the result clause now uses the future “will + verb” structure.</p><br>
